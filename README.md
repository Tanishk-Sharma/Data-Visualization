# Data-Visualization

Using the matplotlib library, we can plot different types of charts/graphs.
This is one of the final stages of the Data Analysis process and is extremely valuable for extracting insights from our Data.

While measures like central tendency (mean, median, mode), spread (standard deviation, variance, interquartile range), relationships (correlation), etc give us a good idea about the different features and the degree of their impact on our analysis; Nothing stimulates our decision making as fast as a visual aid. 

This is why Data Visualization plays a very important role.

In this repo, we plot the different graphs using the Iris dataset:

* A Straight Line
* Applying styles
* Bar Plots
* Creating Multiple Plots
* Histograms and Boxplots
* Line and Scatter plots
