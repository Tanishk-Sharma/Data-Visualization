Using the matplotlib library, we can plot different types of charts/graphs.
This is one of the final stages of the Data Analysis process and is extremely valuable for extracting insights from our Data.

In this repo, we plot the different graphs using the Iris dataset:

* A Straight Line
* Applying styles
* Bar Plots
* Creating Multiple Plots
* Histograms and Boxplots
* Line and Scatter plots

In this <a href="https://tanishkblog2020.wordpress.com/2020/11/20/5-most-frequent-charts-for-visualizing-data/">blog post</a>, I have discussed on each of the above charts in brief.
